Overview

Ingenuity is a simple, custom game engine created purely for fun and educational purposes. Built using core technologies like OpenGL for graphics rendering, GLM for math, GLFW for window management, and ImGui for a graphical interface, this engine provides a hands-on experience with game development fundamentals.

Features
1. Real-Time 3D Rendering: Uses OpenGL to render 3D objects, handle lighting, and apply textures.
2. Entity Component System (ECS): Basic structure for managing game objects and their interactions.
3. Math and Vector Support: Powered by GLM, offering robust vector and matrix manipulation.
4. Window Management: GLFW for creating and managing windows and handling input events.
5. Debugging Interface: ImGui provides real-time debugging tools and interface elements to tweak parameters while the game runs.

Technologies
C++: Core programming language for engine architecture.
OpenGL: Handles 3D rendering, shaders, and textures.
GLM: OpenGL Mathematics library for easy vector and matrix operations.
GLFW: Manages window, context, and input handling.
ImGui: Enables a flexible GUI for in-game debugging and development.
